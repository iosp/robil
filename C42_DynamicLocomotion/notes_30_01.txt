Attached a stub for module C42 interface, it contains two actions : 
ZmpWlk and CPGWlk.They will have the same format for now please see pnly a ZMP action :

----
result: 2D position (res_pos) and distance from goal (dis)
----
feedback: distance from goal (dis_to_goal)

the src folder contains the action servers for the tho actions (ZMP is relevant for now)


it waits for start,then goes to path planner and asks for the path, takes one point from path and then loop until this point is reached (distance from goal<tol) 
and publish the distance from goal as feedback
when goal is reached task flagged as success

you can check it out by:
1. building the pkg
2. running ZMPWalkServer.py
3. running a node C31_GetPath_clone.py
4. and then running test_zmp_client.py
A task will be sent to the zmp server. 
Dragging the robot manualy to the requested position (1,1) will mark the 
task as finished

Known Bugs:
==========
Robot takes one step and fall.
