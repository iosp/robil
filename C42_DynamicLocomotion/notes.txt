I attached a stub for module C42 interface, it contains two actions : 
ZmpWlk and CPGWlk, for now both have the same format:

goal : requested 2d position (goal_pos) and tolerance (tol)
----
result: 2D position (res_pos) and distance from goal (dis)
----
feedback: distance from goal (dis_to_goal)

the src folder contains the action servers for the tho actions, for now 
they both do the same thing:
wait for goal, then loop until goal is reached (distance from goal<tol) 
and publish the distance from goal as feedback
when goal is reached task flagged as success

you can check it out by building the pkg, running ZmpServer.py and then 
running test_zmp_client.py, A task will be sent to the zmp server, 
dragging the robot manualy to the requested position (2,0) will mark the 
task as finished

the action server contains some empty functions we will write later, for 
now the function get_path waits for C31 path planning service (which 
name and type we dont know yet)
