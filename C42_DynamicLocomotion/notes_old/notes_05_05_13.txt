Updates:
Ready for Qual integration:
1. Can complete successfully the qual1 path up to stepping stones and from end of stepping stones to finish line.
2. Can be preempted and relaunched. (minor issue when preempted on turn and relaunched) 

USING DYNAMIC WALK:

Robot waits for start,then goes to path planner and asks for the path, takes points from path and walks alongside a segment of two points.

To test Dynamic Walker:

1. run DynamicLocomotion.py: 
   $ rosrun C42_DynamicLocomotion DynamicLocomotion.py

2. run task using C0 task_tester:
   $ rosrun C0_RobilTask task_tester DynamicLocomotion

3. run C31_clone to emulate the C31PathPlanner (publish a path message): 
   rosrun C42_ZMPWalk scripts/C31_Clone.py
 
4. reset robot at initial position:
   rosrun C42_DynamicLocomotion scripts/Reset_start_pose.py
