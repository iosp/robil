Updates:
1. New walk module DynamicLocomotion.
  
USING DYNAMIC WALK:

Robot waits for start,then goes to path planner and asks for the path, takes points from path and walks alongside a segment of two points.

To test Dynamic Walker:

1. run DynamicLocomotion.py: 
   $ rosrun C42_DynamicLocomotion DynamicLocomotion.py

2. run task using C0 task_tester:
   $ rosrun C0_RobilTask task_tester DynamicLocomotion

3. run C31_clone to emulate the C31PathPlanner (publish a path message): 
   rosrun C42_ZMPWalk scripts/C31_Clone.py
