Updates:
Robot completes qual task 1 using dynamic walk:
1. Changed task name from "DynamicLocomotion" to "DynamicQual1".
2. Task needs to be activated once it will return "Task Succeeded" after reaching finishing line. 
3. Position update is from topic: /ground_truth_odom.
4. Robot passes stepping stones using predetermined steps when robot reaches beginning position of stepping stones. 

USING DYNAMIC WALK:

Robot waits for start,then goes to path planner and asks for the path, takes points from path and walks alongside a segment of two points.

To test Dynamic Walker:

1. run DynamicLocomotion.py: 
   $ rosrun C42_DynamicLocomotion DynamicLocomotion.py

2. run task using C0 task_tester:
   $ rosrun C0_RobilTask task_tester DynamicQual1

3. run C31_clone to emulate the C31PathPlanner (publish a path message): 
   rosrun C42_ZMPWalk scripts/C31_Clone.py
 
4. reset robot at initial position:
   rosrun C42_DynamicLocomotion scripts/Reset_start_pose.py
