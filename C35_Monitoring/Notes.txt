How to Check:
============
Requires python ver 2.7.3. In order to test the code, run tests.py from the src/ directory:
python tests.py all
This should take no more than 20 seconds to complete. Check in stdout that all tests succeeded.
tests/ directory contains xml files used as input. distributions/ directory contains some source code. output/ directory is where test output is redirected.

Known Bugs:
==========


Known Limitations:
=================
Currently, the code runs without integration to the executor/designer packages. Input is event xml files with some additions. These additions describe the probability of success in tasks, and time distributions of these tasks given success or failure.
