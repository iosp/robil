Updates:
1. Updated to DRCSim version 2.5.
2. Changed Subscriber to path topic from '/C31PathPlanner' to '/path'.
3. When path is received the waypoints are taken from the first waypoint which distance is greater than 0.5 meters from the robots position.
   Robots current position is taken as first waypoint.
4. Corrected and checked task isPreepted() function that performs an emergency stop (freezes after completing current step).
   
USING ZMP WALK:

Robot waits for start,then goes to path planner and asks for the path, takes points from path and walks alongside a segment of two points.

To test ZMP walk:

1. run zmp_main.py: 
   $ roslaunch C42_ZMPWalk zmp_walk.launch

2. run task using C0 task_tester:
   $ rosrun C0_RobilTask task_tester ZmpWalk

3. run C31_clone to emulate the C31PathPlanner (publish a path message): 
   $ rosrun C42_ZMPWalk scripts/C31_Clone.py

4. reset robot at initial position:
   $ rosrun C42_ZMPWalk scripts/Reset_start_pose.py
   If doesn't work can try a more direct approach (need to specify the exact directory):
   $ python .../Robil/C42_ZMPWalk/scripts/Reset_start_pose.py
 


RUNNING STUB (not checked for this release) :

Robot waits for start,then goes to path planner and asks for the path, takes points from path and makes teleportation between points. 

To test stub:

1. run ZMP_stub.py: 
   $ rosrun C42_ZMPWalk ZMP_stub.py

2. run C31_clone to emulate the C31PathPlanner (publish a path message): 
   $ rosrun C42_ZMPWalk scripts/C31_Clone.py

3. execute using C0 task_tester: 
   $ rosrun C0_RobilTask task_tester FollowPath
