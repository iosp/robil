Updates:
1. Changed task name from C42_ZMPwalk to ZmpWalk.
2. Task waits to receive path after it is called (wont do nothing until path is received).
3. Added reset of states at beginning of task so task can be recalled without reactivating node.
  
USING ZMP WALK:

Robot waits for start,then goes to path planner and asks for the path, takes points from path and walks alongside a segment of two points.

To test ZMP walk:

1. run zmp_main.py: 
   roslaunch C42_ZMPWalk zmp_walk.launch

2. run task using C0 task_tester:
   rosrun C0_RobilTask task_tester ZmpWalk

3. run C31_clone to emulate the C31PathPlanner (publish a path message): 
   rosrun C42_ZMPWalk scripts/C31_Clone.py
 


RUNNING STUB:

Robot waits for start,then goes to path planner and asks for the path, takes points from path and makes teleportation between points. 

To test stub:

1. run ZMP_stub.py: 
   rosrun C42_ZMPWalk ZMP_stub.py

2. run C31_clone to emulate the C31PathPlanner (publish a path message): 
   rosrun C42_ZMPWalk scripts/C31_Clone.py

3. execute using C0 task_tester: 
   rosrun C0_RobilTask task_tester FollowPath
