=========C25_AtlasFell============
----------------------------------

The purpose of this module is to check whether Atlas fell on the ground or not.

This module receives data from the IMU, calculates the pitch and roll of atlas, and if the absolute angle is larger than 80 deg, it sends a True to the topic C35/falling, else it sends false.
