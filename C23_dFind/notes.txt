Object recocnition of drill.
1. Compiling can be done using rosmake in the base directory of the workspace.
2.Move neck joint by 0.8 so that the drill will be in atlas' field of vision.
("neck" movement in Traj_data2.yaml)
3. The three files needed to run the nod are:
   drill (the executable)
   te.txt (file holding the model's used to locate)
   vox.pcd (the model used for now)
I wasn't able to get my program to run from an outside directory so
roscd C23_dFind/bin/
./drill
and the node should run.
Stdout should display a 3x3 rotation matrix, a translation vector, and the fitness score of the recognition.
and a service named perceptionTransform should be created.

********

The recognition isn't perfect yet, turning it on its yaw axis leads to errors (mostly also on the yaw axis)
