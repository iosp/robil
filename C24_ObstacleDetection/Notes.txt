provides a 2d map where each cell represents a 25 cm square
cells are marked 1 for blocked 0 for free and 2 for uncharted

How to Check:
============
run the node with the DRC simulation and the C22 node


rosrun C22_GroundRecognitionAndMapping C22
rosrun C24_ObstacleDetection C24
(at first there is a list of error msgs, not to worry they don't effect the activity of the node)

test with
rosrun C24_ObstacleDetection C24_Test

it is advised to look at the actual pointcloud using rvis in order to get a better image of the mapping
