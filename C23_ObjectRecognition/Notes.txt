C23 Object Recognition.
============================

Version 1.0
Please read the attached manual under docs (docs/manual.pdf)

--------------


Version: beta 0.05
Changes:
1. Added the new Polaris car to detection list.
2. Now detects all objects
3. Added Task TrackObject(object=0/1/2/3/...) for each object

HOWTO:
start atlas: $> roslaunch atlas_utils  atlas.launch
start executer: $> rosrun C34_Executer executer
start C23: $> rosrun C23_ObjectRecognition c23 /multisense_sl/camera/left/image_color  /multisense_sl/camera/right/image_color 
call rosservice with the supplied plan: $> rosservice call /executer/run T plan.xml
    $> rosservice call /executer/resume T


Expected behaviour: if you add the polaris car, and the robot sees the passenger side, it will print and broadcast the coordination.

------------------
Version: beta 0.03

Changes from beta 0.02
1. Added tracking mode, and the car model is saved under /models
2. The module should now detect the car, it is loaded by default.


How to check:
=============
run the node with atlas,
1. roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch
2. place a Gulf car infront of the robot
3. rosrun C23_ObjectRecognition c23 /multisense_sl/left/image_color /multisense_sl/right/image_color
4. look at the output (ROS_INFO), you should see the position of the car, if you see -1, then it means,
 it is not detected, try moving the car around.


Version: beta 0.02

Changes from beta 0.01:
1. Added new class to handle the TLD,
2. Added Learning mode, in order to easly learn new objects.
3. Bug fixes.



How to Check:
============
run the node with the atlas

roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch 
rosrun C23_ObjectRecognition c23 /multisense_sl/left/image_color /multisense_sl/right/image_color 

What to expect : 
The node is now running in "Learning Mode", as it is learning new objects
Steps:
1. Select an object from the image by drawing a box 
2. Press enter
3. Move the object around in the simulation
4. Look at the output (ROS INFO), you should see the position and size of the object.



Known Bugs:
==========
1. Image isn't changing, you can't view the tracking via visulization.
2. The object isn't saved at the end.


Known Limitations:
=================
