C25 - Global Position using Kalman Filter
-----------------------------------------

provides the robots position in the simulation and the corrosponding imu data 
now also provides a global position estimation of detected objects 
Node, now needs C21 to operate
Requirement
===========
You must have the following packages availabe from git:
C21
C25_ekf
libviso2
viso2_ros

Running rosmake on this package will rosmake all the others too.

IMPORTANT!!
===========
please install the laser pipeline package
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-laser-pipeline

Launch file:
============
A launch file was created to ease the use of this, and most of the perception modules.
running
$ roslaunch C25_GlobalPosition C25.launch
will automatically run: C21,C22, activate the laser (spindle)

How to Check:
============
run the node with the DRC simulation

rosrun C21_VisionAndLidar C21

rosrun C25_GlobalPosition C25

test with

rosrun C25_GlobalPosition C25_test
rostopic echo /C25/publish 
one can use the gazebo to look at the actual position of the robot

rosrun C25_GlobalPosition C25_test2
add an object to the simulation so that it will appear in the robot's vision.
draw a square to bound the object the object using the mouse (the same output of C23 will be sent to the C25 callbacks)
an estimated global position of the object will be returned in the terminal.
one can use the gazebo to look at the actual position of the object.
the error varies by the object size,distance and perspective.
