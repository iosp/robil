1) Running C45 launch file will start this module.

Usage:

This module creates the following services:
/PoseController/hand_movement
/PoseController/delta_hand_movement
/PoseController/foot_movement
/PoseController/delta_foot_movement
/PoseController/back_movement
/PoseController/delta_back_movement
/PoseController/neck_movement
/PoseController/delta_neck_movement
/PoseController/start
/PoseController/reset_joints
/PoseController/stop

and advertises to the following topic:
/PoseController/joint_states

You need to call /PoseController/start (with message of type std_srvs/Empty) to enable this module.
/PoseController/stop will stop it and /PoseController/reset_joints will reset the saved joints to the current real values of the robot's joints.

/PoseController/*_movement services set the values of the joints with the inputs.
/PoseController/delta_*_movement services add the inputs as deltas to the joints' values.

This module automatically detects the BDI controller desired behavior (e.g. "Manipulate", "User") and sends the correct k_effort values accordingly.

Update: /PoseController/back_lbz_neck_ay service was added for back_lbz and neck_ay manipulation.
