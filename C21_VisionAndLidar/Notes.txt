Interfaces changed:
parameters passed in the ROS convention

added three new topics:
2 that pass raw data from cameras in raw and compressed form and pass them on to "C21/right_camera/image" "C21/left_camera/image"

in addition to it's known services the node now creates a small panorama from it's two cameras and send it to "/C21/smallPanorama"



How to Check:
============
run the node with the PR2

roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_wg_world.launch 
rosrun C21_VisionAndLidar c21 _left:=/wide_stereo/left/image_raw _right:=/wide_stereo/right/image_raw

test with

rosrun C21_VisionAndLidar test1
rosrun C21_VisionAndLidar test2



Known Bugs:
==========



Known Limitations:
=================
It runs with the gazebo simulation (and not with the drcsim)
