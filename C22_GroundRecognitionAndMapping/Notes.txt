provides a 2d map where each cell represents a 25 cm square
The map now spreads on 25 meters
The service now returns the robot's position in the world and the map offsets (minimal tracked x&y)

the robot's position on the map can be calculated as follows:
row=(robotPos.y-yOffset)*4
col=(robotPos.x-xOffset)*4

How to Check:
============
run the node with the DRC simulation, make sure C21 runs before starting
rosrun C21_VisionAndLidar C21
rosrun C22_GroundRecognitionAndMapping C22

test with

rosrun C22_GroundRecognitionAndMapping C22_test

it is advised to look at the actual pointcloud using rvis in order to get a better image of the mapping
