run the node with the DRC simulation, make sure C21 runs before starting
rosrun C21_VisionAndLidar C21
rosrun C22_GroundRecognitionAndMapping C22

test with

rosrun C22_GroundRecognitionAndMapping C22_test

it is advised to look at the actual pointcloud using rvis in order to get a better image of the mapping
